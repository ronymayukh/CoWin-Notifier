# CoWin-Notifier
This is a small help, to myself and to those who are eager to take vaccine but not able to get one. This app will give you a call whenever any slot is available for booking.

Make a twilio account, and add your details in the index.js file<br>
And add all the field in the code, that are written in Upper Case<br>
Run it in your computer, it will look for a slot every 30s, and give you a call in your desired number from your desired number
